# Notes

## HTML/CSS

- The `data-*` attribute is used to store custom data on all HTML elements.

- `<kbd>` is used to define keyboard input.

### transition

CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

```css
  transition: all .07s ease;
```

### transform

The transform property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

```css
  transform: scale(1.1);
```

## JS

- Get the first `<a>` element that has a `target` attribute:

```html
document.querySelector("a[target]");
```

### addEventListener

- The `transitionend` event is fired when a CSS transition has completed.
